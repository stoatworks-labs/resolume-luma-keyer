/// This does nothing and is meant to. An FxPlug 4 plug-in is an XPC service,
/// and a service is only discoverable if it is embedded in an application the
/// system has registered. So the deliverable is an .app the user drags to
/// /Applications; its only job is to exist there and carry Contents/PlugIns.
///
/// Running it once is a REQUIRED install step, not a courtesy. Copying the app
/// into /Applications does not register the service on its own - measured:
/// `pluginkit -m -p FxPlug` does not list it until either the app is launched or
/// `pluginkit -a` is run by hand. Launching is what the user can be told to do,
/// so the alert below both explains the app and is the moment registration
/// happens.
